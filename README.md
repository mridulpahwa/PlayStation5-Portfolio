# PlayStation5-portfolio
- This project recreates the iconic look and feel of the PlayStation 5 interface through a fully interactive and immersive web experience. Leveraging modern web development technologies and advanced 3D graphics, the website provides a stunning platform to showcase 3D models of the PS5 console and DualSense controller, complete with dynamic animations and effects.

# Key Features
- Interactive 3D Models
- High-quality, optimized 3D models of the PS5 console and DualSense controller.
Models are loaded dynamically using Three.js and include:
Rotations and smooth animations for realistic interactions.
A blinking PS button effect for an authentic touch.

# Technologies Used
